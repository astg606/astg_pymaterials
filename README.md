# ASTG Python Training Materials

This repository contains all the Python materials (mainly Jupyter notebook) 
we use for our training courses.
They are meant to introduce the Python programming language (Python for Beginners)
and Python related tools for Data Science, Machine Learning, Earth Science,
Geospatial Analysis, etc.
We do our best to make the materials self-contained. 
However, a few topics require large data files that only available during live presentations.

Here is a list of topics/tools we have materials on.

### Jupyter Notebook
