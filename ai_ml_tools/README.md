## Introdution to AI/ML with Python

We introducce the general concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). 
We also provide an overview of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
and the parameters we need to consider when we design an ANN for modeling.
Finally, through practical examples, we show how to create AI/ML/DL models
using the Python tools `Scikit-Learn`, `TensorFlow` and `PyTorch`.

This course is designed for participants who:

- Practice Data Science and want to start building their own AI/ML models.
- Are involved in management and want to understand the principle of ML to lead their team.
- Are decision makers and want to make sense of the data generated by ML models.



**Prerequisites**: Familiarity with Python, NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. Participants are also expected to be able manipulate a web browser. A gmail account is needed.

To take this course, you are expected to:

- Have a gmail account (needed to have access to Google Colaboratory). Everything will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook.
- Install on your local machine a Python Distribution. It is not required but it is highly recommended.
   - You can you install the Miniconda Python distribution by following the instructions at: [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)
   - To avoid paying any license fee, do not add to Miniconda and package that comes from the Anaconda repository. You can add on `conda-forge` packages for instance.
