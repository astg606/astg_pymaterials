    "- **Label space** (output): The set of labels or target variables associated with each of the feature vectors make up the label space.\n",
    "- **Training**: The process of determining the ideal parameters comprising a model.\n",
    "- **Training set**: The subset of the dataset used to train a model.\n",
    "- __Hyperparameters__: Model settings that are predefined (by users) and govern the training process. They are chosen before the training procedure starts. In the case of neural networks, they include:\n",
    "  - __Learning rate__: Controls how much the model’s weights are updated during each training step.\n",
    "  - __Dropout rate__: Percentage of neurons to be randomly dropped from the network during training to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "  - __Number of hidden layers__: Specifies the number of layers between the input and output layers in the neural network.\n",
    "  - __Batch size__: Defines how many training examples are used in each iteration (Iterations are the number of batches required to complete one epoch).\n",
    "  - __Number of epochs__: Determines how many times the entire training dataset is passed through the model. Since epochs can get quite large, it is often divided into several smaller batches.\n",
    "- **Validation set**: A subset of the dataset—disjoint from the training set—used in validation.\n",
    "- **Validation**: A process used, as part of training, to evaluate the quality of a machine learning model using the validation set. Because the validation set is disjoint from the training set, validation helps ensure that the model’s performance generalizes beyond the training set.\n",
    "- __Overfitting__: Happens when a model learns certain patterns in the training so well that it performs badly on the validation set. This implies that the model is exclusively applicable to the training and does not adapt to fresh data.\n",
    "  - If for instance the number of epochs is too high, there is a risk of overfitting.\n",
    "- __Underfitting__: Happens when the model performs badly on both training and validation data. \n",
    "  - If for instance the number of epochs is too low the model might be underfitted.\n",
    "- **Prediction**: A model output when provided with an input (from feature space)."
