    "\n",
    "- It bundles together Machine Learning and Deep Learning models and algorithms.\n",
    "- The name `TensorFlow` is derived from the operations which neural networks perform on multidimensional data arrays or `tensors`! It’s literally a flow of tensors.\n",
    "- It was made to be flexible, efficient, extensible, and portable. \n",
    "- It uses Python to provide a convenient front-end API for building applications with the framework, while executing those applications in high-performance C++.\n",
    "- It can train and run neural networks for applications such as handwritten digit classification, image recognition, word embeddings, sequence-to-sequence models for machine translation, natural language processing, and partial differential equations based simulations.\n",

    "5. __Optimizer__: Plug in the optimizers. \n",
