    "2. __Layers__: Allows one to define the tensor in/tensor out computation functions.\n",
    "3. __Callback__: Enables one to program specific actions to occur during training, such as log training metrics, visualize interim/internal states and statistics of the model during training, and perform early stopping when the model converges.\n",
    "4. __Data preprocessing__: Offers support for prepping raw data from disk to model ready Tensor format.\n",
    "5. __Optimizer__: Plug in the optimizers. \n",
    "6. __Metrics__: Is used for assessing the performance of the model during training. A metric is the target to optimize during training, with specific metrics chosen for specific modeling objectives.\n",
