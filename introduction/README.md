## Python Beginner Course for Programmers

This course is designed for participants who want to learn the basic concepts of the Python language and be able to use Python related tools for their work. We cover the following topics: data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, modules, Datetime module, and basic IO with text file.


**Prerequisites**: Ability to program in another language (C, C++, Fortran, Java, Matlab, IDL, etc.). Participants are also expected to be able manipulate a web browser, to open command prompt window or terminal window and edit text files. A gmail account is needed.

To take this course, you are expected to:

- Have a gmail account (needed to have access to Google Colaboratory). Everything will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook.
- Install on your local machine a Python Distribution. It is not required but it is highly recommended.
   - You can you install the Miniconda Python distribution by following the instructions at: [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)
   - To avoid paying any license fee, do not add to Miniconda and package that comes from the Anaconda repository. You can add on `conda-forge` packages for instance.

You might find it useful to learn little more about Jupyter notebook:
