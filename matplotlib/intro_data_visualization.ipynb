It define four broad kinds of visualizations by designing a space with two perpendicular lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static visualizations**:\n",
    "   - Provide all the information at once and do not move. These are, for example, your basic line, bar, and pie charts.\n",
    "- **Interactive visualizations**:\n",
    "   - Allow a transfer of information between the user and the interface. The user clicks, swipes, or hovers, and something happens or additional information is made visible.\n",
    "- **Explanatory visualizations**: \n",
    "   - Bring the results to the forefront; they convey the author’s hypothesis or argument to the reader.\n",
    "- **Exploratory visualizations**:\n",
    "   - Encourage the user to explore the data or subject matter to uncover findings for themselves.\n",

    "- where you publish your content, and \n",
    "- what tools your audience needs to understand the data. \n",
    "\n",
