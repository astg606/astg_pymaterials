    "# Deep learning on MNIST\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to build a simple [feedforward neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) (with one hidden layer) and train it from scratch with NumPy to recognize handwritten digit images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your deep learning model — one of the most basic artificial neural networks that resembles the original [multi-layer perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) — will learn to classify digits from 0 to 9 from the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset. The dataset contains 60,000 training and 10,000 test images and corresponding labels. Each training and test image is of size 784 (or 28x28 pixels) — this will be your input for the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the image inputs and their labels ([supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning)), your neural network will be trained to learn their features using forward propagation and backpropagation ([reverse-mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Reverse_accumulation) differentiation). The final output of the network is a vector of 10 scores — one for each handwritten digit image. You will also evaluate how good your model is at classifying the images on the test set.\n",

    "You are advised to read the [Deep learning](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf) paper published in 2015 by Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton, who are regarded as some of the pioneers of the field. You should also consider reading Andrew Trask's [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning), which teaches deep learning with NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to NumPy, you will be utilizing the following Python standard modules for data loading and processing:\n",
    "- [`urllib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html) for URL handling\n",
    "- [`request`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html) for URL opening\n",
    "- [`gzip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html) for gzip file decompression\n",
    "- [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) to work with the pickle file format\n",

    "This tutorial can be run locally in an isolated environment, such as [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). You can use [Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install) to run each notebook cell.

    "\n",
    "Afterwards, you will construct the building blocks of a simple deep learning model in Python and NumPy and train it to learn to identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with a certain level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural network building blocks with NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Layers_: These building blocks work as data filters — they process data and learn representations from inputs to better predict the target outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You will use 1 hidden layer in your model to pass the inputs forward (_forward propagation_) and propagate the gradients/error derivatives of a loss function backward (_backpropagation_). These are input, hidden and output layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the hidden (middle) and output (last) layers, the neural network model will compute the weighted sum of inputs. To compute this process, you will use NumPy's matrix multiplication function (the \"dot multiply\" or `np.dot(layer, weights)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    > **Note:** For simplicity, the bias term is omitted in this example (there is no `np.dot(layer, weights) + bias`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Weights_: These are important adjustable parameters that the neural network fine-tunes by forward and backward propagating the data. They are optimized through a process called [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent). Before the model training starts, the weights are randomly initialized with NumPy's [`Generator.random()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.Generator.random.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "    The optimal weights should produce the highest prediction accuracy and the lowest error on the training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Activation function_: Deep learning models are capable of determining non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs and these [non-linear functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function) are usually applied to the output of each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You will use a [rectified linear unit (ReLU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) to the hidden layer's output (for example, `relu(np.dot(layer, weights))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Regularization_: This [technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)) helps prevent the neural network model from [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this example, you will use a method called dropout — [dilution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_(neural_networks)) — that randomly sets a number of features in a layer to 0s. You will define it with NumPy's [`Generator.integers()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.Generator.integers.html) method and apply it to the hidden layer of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Loss function_: The computation determines the quality of predictions by comparing the image labels (the truth) with the predicted values in the final layer's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For simplicity, you will use a basic total squared error using NumPy's `np.sum()` function (for example, `np.sum((final_layer_output - image_labels) ** 2)`).\n",

    "\n",
    "    `layer_1` takes the output from the previous layer and performs matrix-multiplication of the input by weights (`weights_1`) with NumPy's `np.dot()`).\n",

    "- _Forward propagation, backpropagation, training loop_:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the beginning of model training, your network randomly initializes the weights and feeds the input data forward through the hidden and output layers. This process is the forward pass or forward propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Then, the network propagates the \"signal\" from the loss function back through the hidden layer and adjusts the weights values with the help of the learning rate parameter (more on that later).\n",

    ">\n",
    ">    With each iteration (epoch) of the neural network training, this forward and backward propagation cycle adjusts the weights, which is reflected in the accuracy and error metrics. As you train the model, your goal is to minimize the error and maximize the accuracy on the training data, where the model learns from, as well as the test data, where you evaluate the model.\n",

    "Building a neural network from scratch with NumPy is a great way to learn more about NumPy and about deep learning. However, for real-world applications you should use specialized frameworks — such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tf_numpy) or [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org) — that provide NumPy-like APIs, have built-in [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) and GPU support, and are designed for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning.\n",

    "Finally, when developing a machine learning model, you should think about potential ethical issues and apply practices to avoid or mitigate those:\n",
    "- Document a trained model with a Model Card - see the [Model Cards for Model Reporting paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3287560.3287596) by Margaret Mitchell et al..\n",
    "- Document a dataset with a Datasheet - see the [Datasheets for Datasets paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010)) by Timnit Gebru et al..\n",
    "- Consider the impact of your model - who is affected by it, who does it benefit - see [the article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02003-2) and [talk](https://slideslive.com/38923453/the-values-of-machine-learning) by Pratyusha Kalluri.\n",
    "- For more resources, see [this blog post by Rachel Thomas](https://www.fast.ai/2018/09/24/ai-ethics-resources/) and the [Radical AI podcast](https://www.radicalai.org/).\n",
