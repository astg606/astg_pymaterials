    "     - **nopython mode** (`nopython=True`): \n",
    "         - Compile the decorated function so that it will run entirely without the involvement of the Python interpreter. \n",
    "         - This mode produces the highest performance code, but requires that the native types of all values in the function can be inferred. \n",
    "         - Note that <font color=\"red\">**`@njit`**</font> is an alias for <font color=\"red\">**`@jit(nopython=True)`**</font>.\n",
    "     - **object mode**: \n",
    "         - In this mode Numba will identify loops that it can compile and compile those into functions that run in machine code, and it will run the rest of the code in the interpreter. \n",
    "         - For best performance avoid using this mode!\n",
    "     - By default Numba will automatically use **object mode** if **nopython mode** cannot be used for some reason. \n",
    "     - When you are in **nopython mode**, types that cannot be inferred by the compiler will generate an error.\n",
    "2. `nogil`: \n",
    "     - Whenever Numba optimizes Python code to native code that only works on native types and variables (rather than Python objects), it is not necessary anymore to hold Python’s global interpreter lock (GIL). \n",
    "     - Numba will release the GIL when entering such a compiled function if you passed `nogil=True`.\n",
    "     - When using `nogil=True`, you need to be wary of the usual pitfalls of multi-threaded programming (consistency, synchronization, race conditions, etc.).\n",
    "3. `cache`:\n",
    "     - To avoid compilation times each time you invoke a Python program, you can instruct Numba to write the result of function compilation into a file-based cache. \n",
    "     - This is done by passing `cache=True`.\n",
    "4. `parallel`: \n",
    "     - Enables automatic parallelization (and related optimizations) for operations in the function known to have parallel semantics.\n",

    "- When Numba compiles machine code for functions, it treats global variables as constants to ensure type stability.\n",
    "- Numba may or may not copy global variables referenced inside a compiled function. Small global arrays are copied for potential compiler optimization with immutability assumption. However, large global arrays are not copied to conserve memory. The definition of “small” and “large” may change.\n",
    "- Numba does not work with recusive function.\n",
    "- For some operations, Numba may use a different algorithm than Python or Numpy. The results may not be bit-by-bit compatible. The difference should generally be small and within reasonable expectations. However, small accumulated differences might produce large differences at the end, especially if a divergent function is involved."

    "1. **Ensure the abstraction of your core kernels is appropriate**. Numba requires the optimization target to be in a function. Unnecessarily complex code can cause the Numba compilation to fall back to object code.\n",
    "2. **Look for places in your code where you see processing data in some form of a loop with a known datatype**. Examples would be a for-loop iterating over a list of integers, or an arithmetic computation that processes an array in pure Python.\n",
    "3. **If you’re using NumPy and SciPy, look at computations that can be stacked in a single statement and that are not BLAS or LAPACK functions**. These are prime candidates for using the ufunc optimization capabilities of Numba.\n",
    "4. **Experiment with Numba’s compilation options**.\n",
